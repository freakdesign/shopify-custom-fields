Shopify custom fields
=====================

![My image](https://freakdesign-us.s3.amazonaws.com/shopify/custom_fields/i/custom_fields_lrg.png)

This a javascript tool to emulate Custom Fields within the Shopify dashboard. The main use would be for Shopify designers and developers wanting to give their clients a simple way to edit metafields with less confusion.

Do note that there's no interface for a Store Owner to make any new fields using this (simply to avoid explosions) so it's up to you - the developer - to help add them. To add the required metafields you'll need to either use [ShopifyFD](http://shopify.freakdesign.com.au/), the [Shopify API](http://docs.shopify.com/api/metafield), or a metafield [app](https://apps.shopify.com/) of your choice. 


Installation and help
---------------------

tl;dr Use the [Chrome Extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/custom-fields-for-shopify/alfplfpobekffinigeidgmmfjollghln).

The Chrome Extension is simply a helper script that loads the files from here. If you don't run Chrome or just prefer to load via a bookmarklet you can follow the instructions on [this page](https://rawgithub.com/freakdesign/shopify-custom-fields/master/installation.html).

A very basic help guide is [available](https://freakdesign-us.s3.amazonaws.com/shopify/custom_fields/freakdesign-custom-fields-for-shopify-guide.pdf).

Exclusions / notes
------------------

* This tool will NOT show metafields under the Global namespace. This is more of a sanity check than anything else.
* Custom field whitelist is loaded once on load. If you change the whitelist after loading it, you'll need to force refresh.


Custom field markers
--------------------

Add these strings into the value (or key) for added magic. Not all of these work yet so consider them a suggestion only that may change at any time.
